            <h3>School projects:</h3>
            <h4>NFA Generator: </h4>
            • Developed an OCaml program that consists of a parser for a simple language and a translator that transforms the parsed input into a non-deterministic finite Automaton, displaying it as a graph. 
            <br>• Leveraged recursion and variant types in OCaml for efficient implementation.
            <h4>Maxima: </h4>
            Jan 2023 - Mar 2023Jan 2023 - Mar 2023 <br>
• Leveraged recursion and variant types in OCaml for efficient implementation.<br> 
• Implemented a code generator that translates parsed input into equivalent Maxima code and executes it, gathering and displaying the output.<br> 
• Utilized variant types in OCaml to implement the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

Skills: OCaml · maxima · Linux · Functional Programming · recursion
            <h4>Banking: </h4>
            • Led a team of developers to create an IoT project using Flutter-Dart to simulate banking transactions.<br>  
• Collaborated closely with company representatives to identify and understand project requirements and objectives. <br> 
• Conducted comprehensive testing and debugging to ensure the smooth functionality of the project.<br>
            <h4>Chess: </h4>
            I wrote a chess game in Java as my final project. In this assignment I took advantage of abstract classes, polymorphism, inheritance and many other tools and techniques. 
<br><br>
• Used JavaFX to create the user interface<br>
• Created methods to handle different game states such as checks, checkmates and pinned pieces<br>
• It is a 2-player game and players can play remotely through a network connection<br>
• Used MySQL database to store players’ name and the game status <br>
